# arduino_dct
A handwritten discrete cosine transformation hopefully able to run on an arduino

Here is a plotted example of a run through sqaurewave which is changin in frequency.
 
	
![Plot](https://github.com/stoertebeker23/arduino_dct/blob/master/documentation/squarewave-f.png)

The first line is a transformation of a 156Hz square wave while the last is a transformation of a 5Khz square wave.
